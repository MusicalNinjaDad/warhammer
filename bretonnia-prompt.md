# Plothooks for Bretonnian travel

I would like you to be a creative sparring partner for me as the gamesmaster for a family TTRPG.

## Context

This is the overview of an ongoing TTRPG epic I am playing with my kids (currently aged 12.75 & 14). We are using the original version of the [WFRP1e](https://wfrp1e.fandom.com/wiki/Table_Of_Contents) rulebook with a few homebrew additions and [a lot of extra lore](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Warhammer_Wiki) and ideas from later editions. We've largely diverged from the traditional WFRP feel of "The world just wants to kill you, when I first played I was killed in the first 5 minutes, by a door-knob" and are aiming more for enjoying playing _epic heros_ in a "grim world of perlious adventure". Our underlying idea is to have fun together telling a story where everyone gets to add to the storyline, this started when we stopped reading bed-time stories together.

Please see the uploaded files for details of the characters and events so far. Use [fandom](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com) for overall world information, gods, places etc.

## The meta-role of the upcoming adventures

My approach to travel is to try and work in adventures which:

1. provide a feel for the world and the places the party is travelling through
1. tie in to underlying plots or character development somehow
1. are fun
1. give a sense of the distance and time involved in getting from one place to another (so more, larger adventures on a longer journey; a short or no encounter on a simple journey)
1. introduce new information or allow for new skills to be developed

Character development:

- Is based upon role-play, not just the career rules
- They have never had a simple "free pass" to upskill just because it's on the career sheet, but needded to find a way to weave it into the story
- As the characters are becoming more developed we are begining to deviate more form the simple career paths and use the story to open up opportunities for them to learn skills or develop stats outside the official limits of their careers.

## Current situation

- The party has just crossed over the marshes between Marienburg and Bretonnia and arrived at a border village
- They have just met Ellis but know her by another name - she is working as a barmaid a the tavern where they are staying and is friendly with the son of the Squib farmers, who they saved from a goblin raid (where Elliot lost his shoe) when transiting the marshes. He accompanied them to the border town after that.
- Bretonnia is like pre-revolutionary France
- Robert is interested in bringing more equality to the peasants
- He may well be recognised and will have both supporters and those who support his brother
- Ulrich was the one who had ranger & hunter skills; the party does not yet know that they are now lacking in these

## Next steps

I need 2-4 ideas for adventures between the border town (West of Marienburg) and Robert's home on the north coast.

The primary focus for the adventures is:

1. to bring Bretonnia to life and
1. give the kids a chance to let their characters shine - we have had a long break from play and a few dull sessions recently
1. not to derail the current plans - to travel to Norsca and find a dragon - this is to give life to travel, not to open up plot-hook overwhelm

I would like to weave in the following topics in a way which opens the door for future adventures once the Skaven are removed from Marienburg:

1. Bretonnian culture & Robert's future role as a force for equality. I don't know much about the French revolution or Napolean, but my son (L) has just been studying it at school and was really engaged
1. The Shallyan church and Shallya's teachings (see fandom for details: Shallya iss very important in Bretonnia & Bretonnia is the seat of the church)
1. The rat catcher's guild and their role in sowing discord / relationship to Tzeentsch (who "blesses" with mutantations)
