## Underlying Themes & Subplots

### Dwarf friend

- Unknown to the party: Singed Beard would be able to craft magical scale-mail armour from dragon scales
- Partially known to the party: The poisoning was actually orchestrated by the [[rat-catchers guild]] using warp-powder (beloved of [[Skaven]]

### Rat-catchers & Heinrich Nagemann ("H.N.")

- Unknown to the party:
  - The rat catchers guilds are being used as a front by Tzeentsch to seed chaos and break up the Old World's alliances:
    - The Stimmigen case was actually about pushing for independence of the halfling home territories
    - The case in Ãœbersreik was to break apart the friendly relationships between humans and dwarves
  - The ratcatchers guilds are in alliance with many Skaven
    - The skaven three-horned god (often considered to be another persona of Nurgle) has an unknown adversary, which is another of Tzeentsch's faces
  - Tzeentsch & Nurgle are notorious enemies - the party has begun getting invoved in stopping Tzeentsch, but don't yet know about how this would reflect on Nurgle's power or the overlap with the Skaven gods & power struggles.

### Nurgle & Nuln

- Unknown to the party: After successfully completing the Oldenhaller Contract and stopping the spread of Nurgle's rot, the party unknowingly allowed Nurgle's ring to fall into the hands of someone who is using it to take over Nuln.
- At some point in the future there will likely be a need for Raya to take Shallya's powers there and for the party to save the city.

## Story so far

- Act 2: Roadtrip to find the beetle poison (avoided big boss battle by collecting it from a group of Skaven where thy think they saw H.N. leading them)
  - Were accosted just before Delberz and imprisoned by corrupt guards & officials
    - Unknown to the party: the guards were collecting slaves for the Skaven who live under the city (in collaboration with the rat-catchers guild)
