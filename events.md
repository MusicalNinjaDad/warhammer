## Underlying Themes & Subplots

### Dwarf friend

- Infamous in dwarven circles
- Saved Master Smith Oldor Skorrinson of the Hazmat Clan ("Singed Beard") for a group of orcs. Who has promised to repay the debt if ever they need it.
- Saved Master Brewer "Foambeard"'s reputation, who had been blamed for poisoning Ãœbersreik - an outbreak that lead to a full-town lockdown

### We want to close the chaos portals in the North

This is the original overall aim of the players

### We want to meet Shallya and Verena in person

This has developed as a new, additional, aim of the players

### Rat-catchers & Heinrich Nagemann ("H.N.")

- H.N.
  - has a tentacle growing out of his back which he can use as an additional arm
  - can turn into a rat to escape
  - can call a band of rats or skaven
  - first met: as the lead of the rat-catchers guild in Stimmigen where he was trying to displace a well-respected Halfling (& town council member) during Pie-Week (during the first main series of adventures)
  - possbile sighting from afar (unconfirmed): at the end of the Second

### Truth-seeker

What is the true story of the weapon and what powers does it have?

### Shallya's true teachings and corruption in the church

- The more senior members of the church who we have met have often appeared aloof and hipocritical / bigotted. The junior members very caring and kind.
- Raya found some text written in Shallya's own hand suggesting that the current understanding of "who" to show mercy to and "pacifism" has warped over time.

### Nurgle & Nuln

- There have been a few repeated hints and rumours of a change in power in Nuln and of some strange outbreaks of disease there.
- So far the players have chose to avoid the place as they do not have good memories of the city.

## Story so far

There were multiple adventures along the way during each act, but these are the main Acts and the individual adventures ones most relevant to the next steps of the story:

- Intro: Oldenhaller Contract
- Act 1: From Nuln to Altdorf, protecting "Gretchen" a barge owned by [[Albert Steinhauser]] on the Vorbergland canals
- Intermission: In Altdorf over winter. Got to know a noble who's son was terribly ill - the poison of a rare beetle found in the forests in his home realm was rumoured to be the only cure. Eliot trained a war horse for him and received Storm in return
- Act 2: Roadtrip to find the beetle poison (avoided big boss battle by collecting it from a group of Skaven where thy think they saw H.N. leading them)
  - Were accosted just before Delberz and imprisoned by corrupt guards & officials
- Act 3: Built their own horse-transporting boat and went into business with [[Albert Steinhauser]] to transport horses and other goods up the river as the roads through Delberz were becoming too dangerous and the river is passable for more of the year than the roads. Horse transport by boat had never been done before in the Empire.
  - Stopped at a mid-river island asylum / fortress where they saved [[Robert de-Caucy]] who was being held there by his brother but one of their party [[Ulrich Franzenhammer]] lost a leg to a group of fear-demons. Raya managed to save the leg but he is no longer with the party and staying in Marienburg where he recovered.
- Act 4: In Marienburg
  - Found [[Truthseeker]] in a cave under the Verenan temple, only accessible at super low tide when both moons were in alignment
  - Also found a warren of Skaven in these tunnels and decided to find a dragon to clear them out with fire
- Act 5: To Norsca via Bretonnia
  - Decided to travel with [[Robert de-Caucy]] via his home in Bretonnia as he can organise a suitable boat to Norsca where they should find a dragon
