# Underworld factions

Alongside the largest "Shadows of the Rose" there are two additional factions active at the tournament.

- **Copper Vipers**
  - Noble quarter and castle proper
  - Informants network = servants
  - could be **allys**

- **Twilight Thorns**
  - Common grounds and market square
  - Splinter group from shadows of the rose
  - supporting Guy
  - in league with HN

## The Copper Vipers

A mercenary guild masquerading as a legitimate mercantile organization. They specialize in information brokering and "problem-solving" for nobles.

### Structure

- **Leadership**: Run by former noble Catherine "Copperscale" Delacroix
- **Operations**:
  - Legitimate front as trade consortium
  - Network of informants among servants
  - Small team of skilled assassins and thieves
  
### Current Aims

- Gather evidence of noble indiscretions for blackmail
- Secure contracts for "protection" during the tournament
- Investigating rumors of unusual rat activity in the castle cellars

### Notable Members

- **"Copperscale"**: Shrewd leader who lost her title in a political scandal
- **"The Twins"**: Pair of halfling pickpockets who coordinate information gathering
- **Marcel the Sommelier**: Their primary infiltrator in the castle staff

## The Twilight Thorns

A splinter group from the Shadows of the Rose, focused on more aggressive acquisition of power rather than subtle manipulation.

### Structure

- **Leadership**: Council of three ("The Thorns")
  - Master of Coin
  - Master of Shadows
  - Master of Whispers
- **Operations**:
  - Protection rackets in the tournament grounds
  - Gambling operations
  - Smuggling rare goods
  
### Current Aims

- Establish dominance over tournament black market
- Support Guy de Caucy's regime (paid handsomely for this)
- Working with certain ratcatchers
- Eliminate competition from other criminal elements
- Disrupt any potential support for Robert's return

### Notable Members

- **"The Butcher"**: Former knight turned enforcer
- **Lady Midnight**: Runs their gambling operations
- **"Ratwhisper"**: Their connection to the corrupted ratcatchers

## Underworld Plot Hooks

### 1. The Twin's Proposition

- The Copper Vipers' halfling duo spots Ellis's talents
- Offer to share intel about Guy's plans in exchange for help infiltrating a noble's pavilion
- Twist: The target is actually loyal to Robert, but the Twins don't know this
- Could lead to: Finding evidence of mind control over Robert's mentor

### 2. Twilight's Challenge

- Lady Midnight sets up an exclusive high-stakes gambling den
- Challenges Ellis to prove herself by marking cards or running a rigged game
- Real purpose: Testing her loyalty while gathering blackmail material on noble players
- Warning sign: "Ratwhisper" lurks in the shadows, watching too intently

### 3. Copperscale's Ledger

- Catherine "Copperscale" needs a forger to alter records in her trading ledger
- Claims it's to hide legitimate profits from taxation
- Actually contains evidence of rat-folk activity in the castle cellars
- Dilemma: The altered records could protect or expose the truth

### 4. The Sommelier's Secret

- Marcel (Copper Vipers' castle infiltrator) leaves coded wine orders
- Ellis could intercept/decode messages about noble movements
- Opportunity to plant false information benefiting Robert
- Risk: "The Butcher" is watching Marcel, suspecting a leak

### 5. Tournament Market Tensions

- Twilight Thorns demanding protection money from market vendors
- Copper Vipers offering cheaper "insurance"
- Perfect cover for Ellis to:
  - Gather intelligence from both sides
  - Help protect innocent merchants
  - Potentially expose Thorns' connection to ratcatchers
  - Create division between criminal factions
