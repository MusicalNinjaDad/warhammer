# Shallyan presence at Tournament

## The Shallyan Hospital Tents

A long row of pristine white tents stretches along the edge of the sea-cliffs, their canvas sides fluttering in the salt breeze. The tents are marked with the gentle hand-and-dove sigil of Shallya, and blue ribbons flutter from their guy ropes. The air here is fresh with the scent of sea spray, mingled with the subtle fragrance of healing herbs and incense drifting from within. Soft voices murmur prayers and gentle encouragement, while the distant crash of waves provides a soothing backdrop.

Inside, the atmosphere is calm and orderly. Novices and priests in white robes move quietly between cots, tending to the wounded and weary with practiced care. Bowls of clean water, fresh bandages, and simple charms of mercy are everywhere. The presence of the Shallyans brings a sense of hope and peace, their compassion a stark contrast to the competitive fervor of the tournament grounds just beyond.

The hospital tents are positioned close to the noble quarter for swift access to injured knights, but all are welcome—commoners, competitors, and even the destitute find comfort here. At dawn and dusk, soft hymns rise from the tents, blessing the living and remembering the lost, their voices carried far out over the sea.

## Key Shallyan Characters at the Tournament Hospital Tents

### Sister Mireille (Initiate, Young Woman)

## Shallyan Plot Hooks

1. **Outbreak in the Common Area**
   - A sudden outbreak of fever and sickness spreads among the commoners’ tents. The Shallyans are overwhelmed and suspect poor sanitation, but clues (strange herbs, rat droppings, many petals are caught in the outbreak) point to deliberate sabotage by the Twilight Thorns. Resolving this could earn the party the gratitude of the Shallyans and expose underworld plots.

2. **Absent Senior Clergy**
   - The most senior Shallyan priests are conspicuously absent, having been urgently summoned to Couronne (just a day’s ride away) for a secretive council. Rumors swirl of a crisis in the capital—perhaps a heresy, a schism, or a dire prophecy. Raya is encouraged to travel there after the tournament, both for her own advancement and to uncover the truth behind the church’s troubles.

3. **A Lost Relic**
   - Sister Odette quietly confides that a minor but meaningful Shallyan relic (a silver dove pendant) has gone missing from the hospital tents. It may have been stolen by a desperate patient, a thief, or even someone seeking to use it in a dark ritual.
