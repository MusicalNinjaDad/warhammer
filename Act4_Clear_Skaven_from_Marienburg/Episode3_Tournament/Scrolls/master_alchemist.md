Running a market stall
Calls out to Raya: "You looking for a love potion, ... no - that's not your problem, maybe a de-lusting? ... ah a Shallyan - a scroll or potion to help with healing?"
Roll Fel to see how much help he will give. He will likely want to keep the scrolls but may also charge for ingredients and even his time.

When he hears of her abilities with L3 heal injury is astounded - "I've heard of the spell but never heard of it being so flexible. Usually it will just help with a broken bone or something like that". "You must be particularly talented". "What's important is to impart the meaning of the spell into the scroll - most people have to use words for that, some even have to write in arcane Magik - and that can make it hard for others to understand and use the scroll. But if you can do that without words, then that's amazing".

Notices her purple ribbon - "Interesting: I've not seen one of those in years and then two in one week!"

## Narrative Description

"You looking for a love potion, ... no - that's not your problem, maybe a de-lusting? ... ah a Shallyan - a scroll or potion to help with healing?" The merchant's keen voice cuts through the market's bustle, drawing attention to one of the more prominent stalls at the crossroads. Its striped awning billows like a noble's banner above rows of gleaming brass scales and meticulously arranged wares. The sharp scent of imported spices mingles with the earthier aroma of local herbs, while strings of dried flowers dance in the breeze alongside hanging crystals that catch and scatter the sunlight. Behind his polished oak counter stands Étienne Beaufort himself, a lean man with calculating eyes and ink-stained fingers, his merchant's robe adorned with small pouches and that ever-present chain of mysterious keys.
