# Étienne Beaufort ("The Wise Trader")

Calls out to Raya: "You looking for a love potion, ... no - that's not your problem, maybe a de-lusting? ... ah a Shallyan - a scroll or potion to help with healing?"

One merchant's keen voice cuts through the market's bustle, drawing attention to one of the more prominent stalls at the crossroads. Its striped awning billows like a noble's banner above rows of gleaming brass scales and meticulously arranged wares. The sharp scent of imported spices mingles with the earthier aroma of local herbs and something a little less pleasant, while strings of dried flowers dance in the breeze alongside hanging crystals that catch and scatter the sunlight. Behind his polished oak counter stands a lean man with calculating eyes and ink-stained fingers, his merchant's robe adorned with small pouches and around his neck hangs a metal chain tucked into his flowing robes.

## Interactions

- Roll **Fel** to see how much help he will give.
  - **SL < +3:** He will want to keep the scrolls
  - **SL < +2:** charges for ingredients
  - **SL < -3:** will charge for his time.

- Notices her **purple ribbon** - "Interesting: I've not seen one of those in years and then two in one week!"

## Quirks & Mannerisms

- Habitually adjusts his merchant's scales even when not weighing anything
- Speaks in precise numbers and measurements, even in casual conversation
- Wears a collection of small keys on a chain around his neck, occasionally touching them for "luck"

## Motivations

- **Primary:** Profit through clever trading and information gathering
- **Secondary:** Secretly documents local folklore and trading histories in leather-bound journals, believing that understanding the past leads to predicting future market trends

## Backstory

This background explains his obsession with measurement and record-keeping while giving depth to his character beyond simple merchant motivations. It also provides several potential plot hooks through his informant network or hidden documents.

### Early Life

- Born to a failed merchant and washerwoman in L'Anguille
- Apprenticed to an eccentric alchemist who valued precision above all else
- Discovered early talent for remembering exact measurements and formulae
- Mother's stories of her noble ancestry (likely fabricated) instilled desire for status

### Pivotal Moment

- During plague years, successfully predicted which herbs would be in demand
- Made first fortune by stockpiling right before outbreak
- Used profits to establish legitimate trade routes
- Carries guilt about profiting from others' suffering

### Current Situation

- Maintains network of informants among market folk across Bretonnia
- Records everything in his journals - prices, weather patterns, local gossip
- Claims to be widowed, but wife actually left him for a Tilean merchant
- Lives above his shop in a cluttered apartment filled with books and specimens
- Secretly hopes his meticulous record-keeping will earn him a place in noble archives

### The Truth Behind the Keys

- Each key on his chain opens a different hidden compartment in his shop
- Most contain mundane items, but three are special:
  - His real trading ledger
  - Letters from his ex-wife he can't bring himself to burn
  - A small collection of "questionably obtained" scholarly texts
