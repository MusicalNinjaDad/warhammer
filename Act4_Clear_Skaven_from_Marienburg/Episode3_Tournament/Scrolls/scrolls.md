# Creating Scrolls

- **d2** hours per level
- **WP** test every hr
- Can use **MP** to help with failed WP tests `(SL * d(2*level) )`

## Remarks to Raya

- When he hears of her abilities with **L3 heal injury** he's **astounded**:
  - "I've heard of the spell but never heard of it being so flexible. Usually it will just help with a broken bone or something like that".
  - "You must be particularly talented".

- **Read/Write**: "What's important is to impart the meaning of the spell into the scroll - most people have to use words for that, some even have to write in arcane Magik - and that can make it hard for others to understand and use the scroll. But if you can do that without words, then that's amazing".

## Calm (L2)

- Must be written with a down quill
- If feather given freely:
  - Birds: **Half Cl** as _bonus_ to WP tests
  - Dove: Cl = 10
  - Squeek (was 24 in early y2 of game, adult is 66 - but he's a pygmy): Cl = 24 + d(20)

## Heal Injury (L3)

- Written on a piece of lint
- Ink must include troll blood & be mixed by someone with manuf. potions
- There is a similar spell at L4 - which needs a bit of troll brain
  - trolls are nasty:
    - their stomach juice can disolve anything or anyone very fast
    - they can regenerate even when nearly dead (must remove head - see use of petuitary gland)
