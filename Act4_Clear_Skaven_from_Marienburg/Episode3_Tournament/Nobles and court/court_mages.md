### **Larme de Lune** ("Moon’s Tear")

**Description:**  
A delicate, silver-leaved herb with pale blue, bell-shaped flowers that only open at night under the moonlight. The petals glisten with dew even in dry weather, and the plant emits a faint, calming fragrance reminiscent of lavender and myrtle. Indigenous to the sun-warmed hills of southern Estalia and Tilea (Spain and Italy), it is notoriously difficult to cultivate outside its native soil. In Bretonnia, it is prized by alchemists and healers for its rare properties in counteracting mind-altering magics and soothing troubled spirits.

**Properties:**  

- Used in potions to resist or break enchantments  
- Flowers must be harvested by moonlight for full potency  
- Sensitive to changes in soil and easily sabotaged by subtle poisons or neglect

**Voice:**

> like a gentle breeze at midnight or the distant sound of chimes

- soft
- musical
- whispering

> Its words seem to echo and linger, soothing and calming, with a faint accent reminiscent of southern lands.

**Personality:**

- Speaks in poetic phrases and metaphors about the moon, night, and dreams  
- Cautious and shy at first, but warms to those who show respect for nature
- Above ground: Gentle, poetic, and shy; sensitive to touch and kindness; prefers gentle hands and soft voices
- Below ground: Strong-willed, resilient, and wise; remembers hardship and endures adversity; can be blunt or surprisingly direct when discussing survival or threats
- May recognize and respond to similar dualities in Ellis—her softness and empathy, or her hidden strength and resilience—depending on how she approaches the plant
- Wary of those who rush or force, but loyal and open to those who show patience and respect for both strength and vulnerability

**Quotes:**  

- Above ground:
  > The moon’s tears fall only for those who wait in silence.
  > Petals open to gentle hands

- Below ground:
  > Beneath the soil, I have weathered storms and poison alike.  
  > Roots have long memories both for kindness and hard times
  > Strength is not always seen, but always felt.  
  > If you listen with your heart, you will hear the stories my roots remember.

- To Ellis:
  > What troubles you, child of the sun and shadow?
  > Some reach for the moon, others cling to the earth. I do both, and so, perhaps, do you.  

> Will you tend to my wounds with patience, or seek only the flower and forget the root?
