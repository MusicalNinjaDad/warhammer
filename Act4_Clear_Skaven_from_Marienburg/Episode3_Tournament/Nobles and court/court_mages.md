# Magister Elenara Vaelith

High Elf, Female

- Magister Elenara Vaelith is a **tall, graceful High Elf** with an **ageless beauty** that seems to **radiate an aura of calm authority**.
- Her **long, silver hair** flows like liquid moonlight, and her **piercing violet eyes** seem to see through to the very soul of those who meet her gaze.
- She wears **flowing robes of deep indigo, trimmed with silver embroidery in intricate arcane patterns**, and a **delicate circlet of metal** rests upon her brow.
- A **staff** of **polished white ash**, **topped** with a **crystal** that **glows faintly** with an **inner light**.
- Her **voice** is **soft yet commanding**, carrying the weight of centuries of **wisdom**.

## Personality

Elenara is serene and composed, rarely showing emotion beyond a faint smile or a raised brow. She speaks with precision and deliberation, often pausing to consider her words carefully. While she is deeply knowledgeable in the arcane arts, she is also pragmatic, understanding the complexities of court politics and the need for subtlety. She is loyal to the ideals of justice and balance, but her long life has taught her the necessity of compromise.

## Relationship with Ellis

- Initial reaction: short, a little impatient, disinterested
  - is very busy right now
- Needs support with some plants
- Will respond well over time
  - sees something of her old self in her
  - likely to suggest to Ellis that she is less "forthright" in the company of nobles
  - but is a breath of fresh air, when she is not over tired

## Insight into Court Politics

Elenara is aware of the second-in-command's schemes but is cautious about revealing too much.

Cryptic hints:
> "Beware of those who wear loyalty as a mask. The court is a stage, and not all players are what they seem."
