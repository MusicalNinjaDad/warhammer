# On arrival

The whole scene is alive with movement and sound - from the snap of countless banners in the sea breeze to the distant crash of waves against the cliffs. The air carries a mix of salt spray, woodsmoke, roasting food, horse, and the sweet summer grass crushed under thousands of feet. It's a festival for all the senses, promising spectacle, intrigue, and opportunity in equal measure.

## 1. Signing up for the lists

- Sir Laurent suggests you head to the centre to sign up for the lists

- **Cleric Alaric**
  - wiry man in late 40's
  - sharp nose & pericing blue eyes
  - robes of a muted blue, with silver trim
  - small meticulously written ledger on the wooden table in front of him, otherwise empty except for a quill, inkwell and small, folded cloth for blotting

- **Fel** or **Ld** roll to persuade cleric to allow Eliot to sign up
  
  - **High SL Pass**: Alaric as Ally: If the party impresses him (e.g., with a high roll or clever roleplay).
    - Alaric becomes a minor ally, offering advice about the tournament or even quietly rooting for Eliot.
    - "Your companion behind you reminds me of someone I once knew. Donâ€™t disappoint me."
  
  - Either Eliot or Sir L will **fail** to be accepted and require written support from a nobel sponsor
    - "I must insist on proper sponsorship. Perhaps one of the lords or ladies here will take pity on your plight. Or perhaps not."
    - "Of course, I only accept authentic sponsorships. But I am not an expert in handwriting... as long as it looks convincing."
    - Sir L: Will be hard to find, may well be easier to forge a document, Sir L has an idea where he could find someone to help

## 2. Pass through market on way to camp
