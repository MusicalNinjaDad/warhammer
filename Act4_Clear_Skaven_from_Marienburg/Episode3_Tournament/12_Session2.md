  - was directed to meet coppers in market next morning
  - met twins - given a token to meet Lady Copperscale at 14:00
- Raya:
  - completed Heal Injury scroll in 5 hours
  - gained Manuf. Scrolls skill
  - used most of her MP to do so
  - will be late back to lunch
  - learned that Moon's Tear is useful in very many magical potions - usually for breaking spells related to the mind
- Elliot:
  - Has started to get noticed & liked by other participants
  - Getting nickname "Hibou"
  - Fought Damien
  - 5-1 points on Lance
  - Took 1W
  - Allowed Damien to attack first in sword fight, then parry-blocked & disarmed him with shield, kicked him over & forced him to yield
- Party:
  - Built a mad-dwarven tent, with adjustable height bedrooms
  - Raya failed the Dex check - the human's bedroom height adjustor doesn't have a locking pin on the cog-wheel, just a locking handle

### To Check

- Ellis' Int roll (and bonus used) while waiting at market. How much of the `Tournament Market Tensions` did she spot?
