## First Sight of the Tournament Grounds

Met Sir Laurent on the way

As you crest the brow of a small hill on the morning of the 4th day of riding, you catch your first glimpse of the sea. The midday sun sparkles on the waves which crash up against high, grey cliffs. A beatiful stone castle stands windswept at the edge of the land, surrounded on 3 sides by vertical cliffs. Silver and blue pennants fly from the turrents of the castle, and enormous banners cascade down its towers, their deep blue and silver fabric rippling in the salt breeze, each emblazoned with golden crossed swords.

As awe-inspring as Robert's family home is, you can't help but be drawn to the sprawling mass of the tournament grounds in front of it: opposite the town and strewn across the still-somewhat green fields to the right of the road, lies a vast tent city that transforms the landscape into a living tapestry of color and movement. The tournament grounds are clearly divided into distinct areas, as you ride closer you begin to make out more and more details, and become more aware of the sounds _and smells_ of what must be hundreds of people, if not over a thousand.

## On arrival

The whole scene is alive with movement and sound - from the snap of countless banners in the sea breeze to the distant crash of waves against the cliffs. The air carries a mix of salt spray, woodsmoke, roasting food, horse, and the sweet summer grass crushed under thousands of feet. It's a festival for all the senses, promising spectacle, intrigue, and opportunity in equal measure.

### Signing up for the lists

- Sir Laurent suggests you head to the centre to sign up for the lists

- **Cleric Alaric**
  - wiry man in late 40's
  - sharp nose & pericing blue eyes
  - robes of a muted blue, with silver trim
  - small meticulously written ledger on the wooden table in front of him, otherwise empty except for a quill, inkwell and small, folded cloth for blotting

- **Fel** or **Ld** roll to persuade cleric to allow Eliot to sign up
  
  - **High SL Pass**: Alaric as Ally: If the party impresses him (e.g., with a high roll or clever roleplay).
    - Alaric becomes a minor ally, offering advice about the tournament or even quietly rooting for Eliot.
    - "Your companion behind you reminds me of someone I once knew. Don’t disappoint me."
  
  - Either Eliot or Sir L will **fail** to be accepted and require written support from a nobel sponsor
    - "I must insist on proper sponsorship. Perhaps one of the lords or ladies here will take pity on your plight. Or perhaps not."
    - "Of course, I only accept authentic sponsorships. But I am not an expert in handwriting… as long as it looks convincing."
    - Sir L: Will be hard to find, may well be easier to forge a document, Sir L has an idea where he could find someone to help

## Areas / Layout

### The Lists

The tournament field proper dominates the center - a vast rectangular space marked by blue and silver pennants. Two grand stands face each other across the tilting lanes, their wooden structures draped in noble house colors. The morning sun glints off the freshly raked sand of the combat circles, while practice targets already bristle with arrows.

### The Staging Grounds

Near the lists, an area has been set aside for competitors to prepare. The ring of hammers on armor mingles with the snort of warhorses. Pages and squires polish armor that catches the sun like mirrors, while practice weapons clack against each other as knights warm up.

### Noble Quarter

Closest to the castle, a collection of luxurious pavilions forms a crescent of wealth and privilege. Here, silk banners snap in the wind and servants bustle between tents large enough to host feasts. The golden stag of Baron Étienne particularly stands out among the assembled noble heraldry. (Étienne = who you delivered Gérard the corrupt tax collector to)

Note: The Nobles closest to Guy are housed in the castle. Those in tents _may_ feel subtly rebuked.

### Market Square

A bustling marketplace has sprung up near the main road - a maze of stalls and awnings where merchants hawk everything from weapons to trinkets. The air here is rich with the mingled scents of food vendors' wares - roasting meats, fresh bread, and exotic spices. The constant clamor of haggling and entertainment rises above the general din.

### Pilgrim's Rest

The church has established a significant presence - their white tents arranged in neat rows, marked by Shallyan symbols and offering healing and blessing to competitors and spectators alike. The gentle sound of chanting drifts across the grounds, mixing with the smoke of sacred incense.

### Common Ground

- The **largest section** spreads outward from the center - a sprawling, organic growth of **smaller tents and campfires** where common folk gather.
- Here, **wandering entertainers** practice their acts, the sound of **laughter and music** mixing with the **smell of cookfires** wafting on the breeze which thankfully covers the worst of the sweat.
- **Children** dart between tents flying **makeshift banners** and holding **branches** between their legs **pretending** they are **knights on horses**. Dogs chase each other through the crowds.
