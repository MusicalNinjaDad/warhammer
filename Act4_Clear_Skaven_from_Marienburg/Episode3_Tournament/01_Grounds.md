## First Sight of the Tournament Grounds

As you crest the final hill, the vista before you takes your breath away. Guy de Caucy's castle rises majestically from the sea cliffs - its pale stone walls catching the morning light like silvered armor. Enormous banners cascade down its towers, their deep blue and silver fabric rippling in the salt breeze, each emblazoned with the golden anchor of House de Caucy.

Below, sprawling across the summer-green fields between the cliff and your vantage point, lies a vast tent city that transforms the landscape into a living tapestry of color and movement. The tournament grounds are clearly divided into distinct areas:

### The Lists

The tournament field proper dominates the center - a vast rectangular space marked by blue and silver pennants. Two grand stands face each other across the tilting lanes, their wooden structures draped in noble house colors. The morning sun glints off the freshly raked sand of the combat circles, while practice targets already bristle with arrows.

### Noble Quarter

Closest to the castle, a collection of luxurious pavilions forms a crescent of wealth and privilege. Here, silk banners snap in the wind and servants bustle between tents large enough to host feasts. The golden stag of Baron Ã‰tienne particularly stands out among the assembled noble heraldry.

### Market Square

A bustling marketplace has sprung up near the main road - a maze of stalls and awnings where merchants hawk everything from weapons to trinkets. The air here is rich with the mingled scents of food vendors' wares - roasting meats, fresh bread, and exotic spices. The constant clamor of haggling and entertainment rises above the general din.

### Pilgrim's Rest

The church has established a significant presence - their white tents arranged in neat rows, marked by Shallyan symbols and offering healing and blessing to competitors and spectators alike. The gentle sound of chanting drifts across the grounds, mixing with the smoke of sacred incense.

### Common Ground

The largest section spreads outward from the center - a sprawling, organic growth of smaller tents and campfires where common folk gather. Here, wandering entertainers practice their acts, the sound of laughter and music mixing with the smell of cookfires. Children dart between tents flying makeshift banners, while dogs chase each other through the crowds.

### The Staging Grounds

Near the lists, an area has been set aside for competitors to prepare. The ring of hammers on armor mingles with the snort of warhorses. Pages and squires polish armor that catches the sun like mirrors, while practice weapons clack against each other as knights warm up.

The whole scene is alive with movement and sound - from the snap of countless banners in the sea breeze to the distant crash of waves against the cliffs. The air carries a mix of salt spray, woodsmoke, roasting food, horse, and the sweet summer grass crushed under thousands of feet. It's a festival for all the senses, promising spectacle, intrigue, and opportunity in equal measure.
