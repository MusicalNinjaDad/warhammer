# Guy de Caucy's Tournament

this is culmination of the first arc of this Act and of the party's saving of Robert de Caucy.

Style of play: A bit different - the tournament will last a few days (and sessions) with location-based plots & opportunities - so we'll be jumping between locations and activities regularly with the different characters.
