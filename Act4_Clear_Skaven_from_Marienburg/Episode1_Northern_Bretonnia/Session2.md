# Session 2

We had a great time yesterday:

- Eliot got some help at the temple of the Lady of the Lake and has begun learning Bretonnian. It's hard going but the rest of the party are helping too and he's no longer quite so disadvantaged when buying things.
- The party headed out and are still in the lands of [[Lord Baudouin de Sanglier]], they stopped to buy shoes at a town: Ellis (still known as "Annette" and still posing as a human rather than a Fey) helped translate as needed and got an idea of the market square.
- Interacting with Marcel Le Soulier was really good fun and in the end Elliot bought a pair of strudy boots, with steel-toecaps and heels as well as a pair of fashionable dress shoes.
- Ellis crafted a metal owl emblem for Marcel to integrate into the dress shoes and then a very fine pair of metal flowers for a him to use on some shoes for a local lord's daughter.
- Marcel introduced Eliot to Franc - a shieldsmith near the market square, who is really interested in heraldry (Eliot grew up as a squire so has Empire Ettiquette and Heraldry knowdlege). He will re-work Eliot's shield to have a field of white (Verenan colour symbolising purity), with a metal owl boss (including a sharp beak and wings to allow the shield to be used as a weapon).
- Karga is aware that Ellis is hiding things (including her real name), has begun to strike up a friendship and challenged her to a competition (Ellis with bow & arrows, Karga throwing her axes) wagering "a free grudge without entry in my book" against "your real name". Ellis won, just...

## Next up

- The party need to stay in the town for 2 more days while Eliot's shield is finished.
- After the heavy focus on Eliot last session Ellis will begin this time.
- The majority of the party is financially very secure, but Ellis is not - this has not yet come up in (N)PC interactions but ...
- Ellis' player has expressed an interest in using her pickpocketing skills developing the friendship with Karga further.

## Picking pockets

If Ellis is going to do some pickpocketing I need help with ideas for:

- one or two likely and interesting marks
- a local member of the thieves guild who will:
  - notice and communicate with Ellis via the thieves secret sign language; either:
    - helping her escape with a diversion and "follow me" if she is spotted or
    - calling to her to give her a warning or ask for a suitable tithe of the proceeds.
  - act as a mixture of guide and protagonist
- a way to then integrate Eliot into the episode as it progresses
  - Verena is the goddess of justice and truth and verenan's are often relied upon to mediate in disputes (in the Empire, but probably not in Bretonnia)
  - he is already a little suspicious of Ellis - he noticed "something a little off" when she handed him Truthseeker but a failed perception test followed by a failed willpower tests lead to nothing more
  - I would like to avoid inter-party conflict. The tone of the game is much more fun when the kids characters help each other rather than antagonise each other - that spills out into out-of-character annoyance:
    - Eliot is played by my son
    - Ellis AND Raya are played by my daughter: I'm not sure if she would be interested in conflict between them and wouldn't want to provke this either way
    - I play Karga and Robert: some light and humourous conflict between them and the others is possible.
