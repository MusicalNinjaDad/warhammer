# Session 2

We had a great time yesterday:

- Eliot got some help at the temple of the Lady of the Lake and has begun learning Bretonnian. It's hard going but the rest of the party are helping too and he's no longer quite so disadvantaged when buying things.
- The party headed out and are still in the lands of [[Lord Baudouin de Sanglier]], they stopped to buy shoes at a town: Ellis (still known as "Annette" and still posing as a human rather than a Fey) helped translate as needed and got an idea of the market square.
- Interacting with Marcel Le Soulier was really good fun and in the end Elliot bought a pair of strudy boots, with steel-toecaps and heels as well as a pair of fashionable dress shoes.
- Ellis crafted a metal owl emblem for Marcel to integrate into the dress shoes and then a very fine pair of metal flowers for a him to use on some shoes for a local lord's daughter.
- Marcel introduced Eliot to Franc - a shieldsmith near the market square, who is really interested in heraldry (Eliot grew up as a squire so has Empire Ettiquette and Heraldry knowdlege). He will re-work Eliot's shield to have a field of white (Verenan colour symbolising purity), with a metal owl boss (including a sharp beak and wings to allow the shield to be used as a weapon).
- Karga is aware that Ellis is hiding things (including her real name), has begun to strike up a friendship and challenged her to a competition (Ellis with bow & arrows, Karga throwing her axes) wagering "a free grudge without entry in my book" against "your real name". Ellis won, just...

## Next up

- The party need to stay in the town for 2 more days while Eliot's shield is finished.
- After the heavy focus on Eliot last session Ellis will begin this time.
- The majority of the party is financially very secure, but Ellis is not - this has not yet come up in (N)PC interactions but ...
- Ellis' player has expressed an interest in using her pickpocketing skills developing the friendship with Karga further.

## Thoughts for encounter

If Ellis is going to do some pickpocketing I need help with ideas for:

- one or two likely and interesting marks
- a local member of the thieves guild who will:
  - notice and communicate with Ellis via the thieves secret sign language; either:
    - helping her escape with a diversion and "follow me" if she is spotted or
    - calling to her to give her a warning or ask for a suitable tithe of the proceeds.
  - act as a mixture of guide and protagonist
- a way to then integrate Eliot into the episode as it progresses
  - Verena is the goddess of justice and truth and verenan's are often relied upon to mediate in disputes (in the Empire, but probably not in Bretonnia)
  - he is already a little suspicious of Ellis - he noticed "something a little off" when she handed him Truthseeker but a failed perception test followed by a failed willpower tests lead to nothing more
  - I would like to avoid inter-party conflict. The tone of the game is much more fun when the kids characters help each other rather than antagonise each other - that spills out into out-of-character annoyance:
    - Eliot is played by my son
    - Ellis AND Raya are played by my daughter: I'm not sure if she would be interested in conflict between them and wouldn't want to provke this either way
    - I play Karga and Robert: some light and humourous conflict between them and the others is possible.

Below is a set of ideas and suggestions that you can mix, match, and tweak on the fly during your session. These ideas should give Ellis’s pickpocketing subplot a vibrant local flavor while drawing Eliot in naturally to support her, all without sparking inter-party conflict.

---

## Likely and Interesting Marks

You might pick one or two of these for Ellis to target during a market stroll:

### 1. **Baron Philippe de Turenne**

- **Who He Is:**  
  A minor noble who prides himself on his fashionable looks and impeccable manners—even if his vanity sometimes exposes him.  
- **Appearance & Manner:**  
  Dressed in an abundance of satin and lace, his richly embroidered doublet and carefully coiffed hair proclaim his station. However, his constant adjustments to his luxurious attire (or his preoccupation with admiring his own reflection in a polished shield or mirror) leave him with a momentary lapse in his guard.
- **What’s in His Pockets:**  
  A heavy coin purse and a few small trinkets that serve as tokens of his vanity (perhaps a signing of a heraldic crest or a family crest medallion).  
- **Why He’s Interesting:**  
  He gives Ellis plenty of room to work her subtle magic, all while demonstrating the stark contrast between ostentation and the practical spirit of everyday Bretonnian folk.

### 2. **Monsieur Armand Duval**

- **Who He Is:**  
  A flamboyant local merchant known as much for his flashy trade as his over-the-top self-promotion in the town’s market square.  
- **Appearance & Manner:**  
  Armand’s attire is striking—rich fabrics, glittering accessories—and he walks with an air of self-assurance that borders on theatrical. His purse, nearly bursting with coins and embossed with elaborate designs, is as much a status symbol as it is his livelihood.
- **What’s in His Pockets:**  
  An assortment of rare coins and a decorative token that he insists must be kept on him at all times, a perfect lure for an observant pickpocket.
- **Why He’s Interesting:**  
  His larger-than-life personality makes him an easy target if he’s distracted by a confident sales call or a heated exchange with a market rival.

## Hugues “L’Ombre” Lavallée - The Local Thieves Guild Contact

Meet **Hugues “L’Ombre” Lavallée**, the local contact who keeps quiet tabs on all underhand dealings in the market and is ready to spring into action if Ellis finds herself in a tight spot.

### Who He Is

- **Appearance & Demeanor:**  
  Hugues is lean, shifting easily through the crowd in simple but dark garments. His eyes are alert and know every secret corner of the market. He wears a subtle token—a discreet, embroidered cuff or insignia—that marks him as part of the thieves’ network, quickly recognizable to fellow pickpockets.
- **Secret Sign Language:**  
  Hugues communicates using a series of subtle gestures: a sideways glance or a quick, deliberate tap on his hand signals “Follow me!” if he spots approaching guards, or “Keep it quiet” if a mark is getting suspicious. The secret gestures are taught among the guild members and recognized immediately by those in the know—like Ellis.
- **Role & Motivation:**  
  Part mentor and part protagonist, Hugues often guides promising young pickpockets. He might approach Ellis with an urgent signal if she’s spotted or whisper a few encouraging words from the shadows:
  > “La nuit est notre amie, petite ombre… follow me.”
  
  He may also demand a small tithe from any successful score—a token contribution to the guild—but may be lenient (or even wink them off) for those proving themselves useful, always with the grace of a seasoned local.

## Integrating Eliot into the Episode

Since Eliot has already expressed subtle suspicions of Ellis (thanks to his earlier encounter with Truthseeker) yet remains a loyal friend, here are ways to draw him directly into the unfolding pickpocketing tale without creating conflict:

### 1. **Unexpected Commotion:**

- As Ellis deftly lifts a coin purse from either Baron Philippe de Turenne or Monsieur Armand Duval, a member of the market guard or an indignant shopper calls out in Bretonnian. Hugues “L’Ombre” swiftly gestures, and Ellis slips away.
- Eliot, witnessing the commotion—and perhaps noticing a precious heraldic token that belonged to the mark (or a tuft of unusual fabric tying back to his own reworked shield design)—steps in to calmly intervene. His presence, bolstered by his newly learned language and cultural etiquette, helps soothe frayed nerves on the scene.
  
  *For instance, Eliot might say in a proper Bretonnian tone:*  
  > “Self-control, good sire/madam. Let us settle this matter as befits our customs.”
  
  This intervention not only defuses the immediate tension but shows the value of his evolving skills.

### 2. **A Cooperative Distraction:**

- Should Ellis be forced into a hurry, Hugues might signal to Ellis and also catch Eliot’s eye from across the bustling square. With a discreet nod that Ellis has seen, Eliot can follow a secondary cue—perhaps a subtle tap on his shoulder or a whispered alert from another local—to help create a safe route.
- This cooperative moment reinforces that the party shares a silent, supportive camaraderie. Eliot’s role as a mediator who appreciates justice (drawing on his knowledge of Verena’s ideals) underscores the bond between the characters without directly challenging Ellis’s abilities.

## Narrative Flow

Below is an ASCII flowchart as a quick reference to keep the scene organized:

```txt
          [Market Square in Caucy]

         ┌──────────┴─────────────┐

Using these ideas, your session can neatly interlace Ellis’s foray into the local underworld of pickpockets with Eliot’s growing cultural competence and sense of justice. Their cooperative handling of the situation not only advances the story but also builds character bonds, ensuring the tone stays fun and supportive.

Have a blast on your session—may the pickpocketing prove as thrilling as it is playful, and may the dice roll in your favor!

## Picking pockets

- Baron Philippe de Turenne is visiting Marcel's shoe stall
- Monsieur Armand Duval is the silk and cloth merchant who has the stall next door
- If Ellis successfully picks one or both pockets then Hugues "L'Ombre" Lavallée will signal her asking for a tithe / threatening her to get off their turf (depending on a fellowship roll)
- If Ellis fails and is noticed, L'Ombre will step in to help with a diversion and escape route. Then proceed as above with a fellowship roll.
- At some point L'Ombre will go and fetch Eliot (either to help, or to threaten depending on how the interaction with Ellis went) or Eliot will be prompted to look for Ellis and Karga either by noticing they have not returned or by an NPC

I need some concrete challenges I can place in front of Ellis, and later Eliot, for them to solve.
They should be:

- open-ended: without a pre-defined solution
- solvable: we have at least 2 ideas of how she could proceed but there are certainly more
- modular, reusable / easily modified: to plug into place however Ellis proceeds
- non-mandatory: so we can drop one, reorder them etc to fit the player's actions
- approx 2/3 related to Ellis, 1/3 related to Eliot
- play to the - play to the following aspects of the PCs:
  - Ellis: thieving, dexterity, hiding, disguise, persuasion, budding friendship with Karga, a bit naughty
  - Eliot: Truthseeker allows for a faith-based roll to boost the results of a perception check when "seeking out the truth", speaks a few words of Bretonian, new shoes, knowledge of *Empire* heraldry & ettiquette, honour & honesty, leadership & standing

Below is a set of modular, open‐ended challenges that you can drop into your session as the pickpocketing subplot unfolds. They’re designed so that Ellis (with a couple of options) and later Eliot (with one challenge) face problems that can be solved in multiple ways, while still shining a light on the skills you mentioned. You can plug them in, reorder them, or drop any if the situation calls for it.

---

## Challenge Module 1 – “The Delicate Lift”

**Situation:**  
Baron Philippe de Turenne is deep in conversation at Marcel’s shoe stall. Right beside him at the silk merchant’s stall, Monsieur Armand Duval hovers, distracted by his own self-admiration. This is Ellis’s moment to try her hand at pickpocketing one or even both.

**Objective:**  
Steal a small treasure (a coin purse, a decorative token, or even a fashionable cufflink) from one or both of the marks.

**Open-Ended Options for Ellis:**  

1. **Stealth & Speed:**  
   - **Method:** Slip through the bustling crowd, approaching while the Baron or Monsieur Duval is momentarily distracted.  
   - **Skill Focus:** Thieving/Dexterity and Hiding.  
   - **Example Roll Trigger:** “Make a Stealth Roll (or Dexterity/Thieving check) to quickly lift the coin purse while your target is engrossed in conversation.”
  
2. **Distraction & Charm:**  
   - **Method:** Use her persuasive side by quietly sparking a rumor or a cheeky remark (perhaps even involving her budding rapport with Karga) that draws their attention away, clearing her path.  
   - **Skill Focus:** Persuasion and Disguise (if she chooses to adopt a local manner or exaggerates her persona).  
   - **Example Roll Trigger:** “Make a Persuasion check to engage and distract either mark, allowing you to pick their pocket unseen.”

**If Successful:**  
Either target loses a small item, and Hugues “L’Ombre” Lavallée—observing the transaction from the crowd—signals Ellis discreetly. His signal (a subtle gesture or coded sign) will either be a cheeky demand for a tithe (if his Fellowship roll is high) or a gruff warning to stay off turf (if the roll is low). In either case, it’s an invitation to interact further.

**If Failing the Check:**  
Ellis gets spotted. At that moment, Hugues “L’Ombre” springs into action to create a diversion. The crowd might suddenly react to a loud merchant cry or a staged argument nearby, allowing Ellis a chance to slip away. Once she’s clear, the same secret signal appears, and the group can regroup.

---

## Challenge Module 2 – “The Run & Hide”

**Situation:**  
Having just attempted her lift, Ellis is either under the watchful eye of some petty local guard or has been cornered by a suspicious vendor. The marketplace’s energy suddenly shifts—the eyes of a few passersby narrow in suspicion.

**Objective:**  
Safely retreat to a secure spot, using her wits and available resources to avoid capture.

**Open-Ended Options for Ellis:**  

1. **Use the Crowd & Environment:**  
   - **Method:** Duck behind busy market stalls, blend into a cluster of locals, or take refuge briefly in a side passage between stalls.  
   - **Skill Focus:** Hiding, Agility, and even some Thieving finesse if she can quickly adjust her appearance (tucking her hair or lowering her hood).
   - **Example Roll Trigger:** “Roll Hiding (or Agility) to find a perfect cover spot and escape the prying eyes.”
  
2. **Engineer a Diversion:**  
   - **Method:** Create a sudden distraction—toss a small object (or even a coin purse previously “acquired”) that will cause a commotion. Perhaps she calls out a few choice words, drawing more attention toward a deliberate mishap.  
   - **Skill Focus:** Persuasion and Dexterity (for a well-timed action).
   - **Example Roll Trigger:** “Make a Dexterity/Persuasion check to stage a convincing diversion that draws attention away from you.”

**Outcome:**  
If she succeeds, Ellis blends into the crowd or creates enough confusion for the alert local (Hugues “L’Ombre”) to arrive on the scene and relay the secret message. If she struggles, the tension increases and might force a hasty decision—perhaps drawing unwanted attention that will later involve Eliot.

---

## Challenge Module 3 – “The Search for Missing Shadows” (Eliot’s Turn)

**Situation:**  
Whether Ellis disappears into the maze of market stalls after a successful pick or a botched run, or if Karga’s banter hints that something is amiss, Eliot notices that his friend hasn’t reappeared after a few minutes of the chaos. Alternatively, Hugues “L’Ombre” might even beckon Eliot directly.

**Objective:**  
Track down Ellis (and possibly Karga) amid the bustling marketplace, using his developing skills and the clues left behind.

**Open-Ended Options for Eliot:**  

1. **Clue Analysis via Truthseeker:**  
   - **Method:** Eliot carefully inspects the scene—searching for a dropped scarf, a peculiar coin, or even traces of disturbed clothing. His new Truthseeker ability might allow him to pinpoint hidden details.  
   - **Skill Focus:** Perception boosted by Truthseeker (with a Willpower roll to add extra insight) and his knowledge of heraldry/etiquette to note the subtle interplay of local markers (e.g., the unique crest on a piece of fabric).  
   - **Example Roll Trigger:** “Roll a Perception Check (with your Truthseeker bonus) to find any evidence that Ellis was here.”
  
2. **Interrogative Approach:**  
   - **Method:** Eliot uses his honed Bretonnian phrases and courtesy to politely query local merchants or even a disoriented street guard. His demeanor, mixed with his Empire etiquette, might coax out a snippet of news about a suspicious figure slipping away near the silk stall.  
   - **Skill Focus:** Leadership and Persuasion, plus a smattering of his local language knowledge.  
   - **Example Roll Trigger:** “Make a Persuasion/Leadership check to gently extract information from a local about the whereabouts of a missing person.”

**Outcome:**  
Success means Eliot pieces together enough clues—a whispered remark, a dropped item’s location, or even a direct signal from Hugues “L’Ombre”—that points him to where Ellis (and Karga) might be hiding. A failure doesn’t spell disaster; it complicates the search, encouraging further role-play, a re-roll, or even the intervention of another NPC to aid his quest.

---

## Integrating the Sequence

1. **Initial Pickpocketing Attempt:**  
   - Ellis targets Baron Philippe de Turenne (and/or Monsieur Duval) at the busy market.  
   - Use Module 1 for her initial lift with her two open approaches.
  
2. **If Noticed – The Escape:**  
   - Should the attempt fail, Module 2 kicks in as Ellis (possibly with Karga’s subtle cues) must find creative means to disappear.  
   - Hugues “L’Ombre” then either signals or assists with an immediate diversion.

3. **Aftermath & Call for Help:**  
   - Whether Ellis succeeds or is forced to run, a noticeable gap or a slight commotion prompts Eliot’s involvement.  
   - Module 3 allows Eliot to step in using his Truthseeker ability—or be directed by Hugues—to track down his missing friend, introducing a mini-investigation that melds with the overall tone of festive mischief and cultural exploration.

Each module is designed to be flexible in order and outcome, giving Ellis plenty of creative choices while gently drawing Eliot into the mix. Both challenges are open-ended enough so that players can come up with imaginative workarounds if they have a sudden idea, yet structured enough to provide clear skill checks and possible narrative beats.

Enjoy your session as these modular challenges bring a lively flair to the market adventure, bolster the team’s camaraderie, and deepen the interplay between mischievous fun and the rich Bretonnian setting!

## Background to the local thieves guild

To help with improvising and providing an immersive atmosphere I need a few ideas on the background to the local thieves guild:

- positioning in the local and regional society
- goals (could just be "staying hidden", could be a bigger ideal / thing they are in the middle of working on)
- rules and customs
- important locations
- if Run & Hide takes Ellis further than just the edge of the market ... how could the interactions develop?

### Les Ombres de la Rose (The Shadows of the Rose)

#### Link to Madame de la Beaucourt & Marcel?

Her daughter's shoe has a prominent flower on it - just like their symbol

#### Positioning in Society

- Operates under the guise of a merchant's cooperative and message delivery service
- Has quiet support from some local merchants who benefit from their information network
- Maintains careful neutrality with the nobility while occasionally doing "favors" for them
- Known to common folk through subtle symbols: a thorned rose etched near doorways

#### Goals

- Primary Goal: Maintain balance between noble/merchant interests to ensure stable commerce
- Immediate Task: Gathering intelligence on Baron Philippe de Turenne's true purpose in town

#### Rules and Customs

**The Three Thorns (core rules):**

1. Never steal from the desperate
1. Always tithe 20% to the guild
1. Keep the shadows, protect the guild

#### Customs

- New members start as "Petals" (scouts/pickpockets)
- Use flower-based code names
- Leave a dried rose petal as calling card for guild messages

#### Important Locations

##### Le Jardin Secret (The Secret Garden)**

Front: A flower shop near the market
Reality: Guild's main meeting point
Run by "Madame Rose" - a Halfling

##### The Thorned Cup**

Tavern with hidden basement meeting room
Regular merchants upstairs, guild business below

##### The Cellar Network

Connected wine cellars under major shops
Emergency escape routes

### Run & Hide Development

If Ellis needs to flee deeper:

- Could be guided to Le Jardin Secret by Hugues
- Might witness guild members tracking suspicious rat-like movements
- Could be offered a "Petal" position if she proves skilled
- Might learn about the guild's concerns regarding increased Skaven activity
- The guild's flower theme and merchant facade provide plenty of roleplaying opportunities while tying into your existing Skaven plot thread.
