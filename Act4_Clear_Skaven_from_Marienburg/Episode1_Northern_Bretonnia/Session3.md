# Session 3

We ran out of time yesterday and left it at a cliffhanger with the kids unsure of how to proceed.

## Session 2 Recap

- Ellis (posing as Annette), and Karga went to the market.
- Baron Philippe de Turenne was flamboyantly dressed (his wife insists) and shopping at Marcel's shoe stall (his shoes arethe clothing he cares about), Monsieur Armand Duval was trying, unsuccesfully, to sell him some a new silk blouse.
- Ellis managed to steal a jeweled bracelt from his arm (just)
- She was seen by Hugues “L’Ombre” Lavallée, who signed for her to follow him into a side-alley
- Ellis and Karga were overpowered (with a sleeping drug on a cloth) and taken to Le Jardin Secret where the woke groggy with their hand tied behind their backs
- L'Ombre
  - tried to intimidate them, to not much success
  - suggested they may offer information in return for their 20% tithe
  - suggested they would find out what Turenne is up to in order to repay their debt to the Ombres de la Rose; and was turned down by Ellis
- Ellis
  - tried to get the weeds to ensnare him but failed - "they clearly know whose garden this is and she couldn't persuade them"
  - Ellis gave him details about the Fae, speaking in hypotheticals and generalisms; insisting this was sufficient knowledge
- Karga is none too happy with Ellis OR L'Ombre
- Eliot, meanwhile, began to wonder where they were and went looking for them
  - Marcel gave him a tip that he has seen them heading into the alley
  - Elliot, with Truthseeker's help spotted tracks and found a wooden petal token
  - He noticed the same petal in the door frame of the flower shop and entered
- When shown the wooden token Mme. Rose took him into the back room
  - Eliot overheard the information Ellis gave about Fae
- When it sounded like they were in danger he tried to sneak out but the door creaked (deliberately)
  - L'Ombre tried to run
  - Eliot kicked the door he was opening super hard and this knocked L'Ombre to the floor
  - Eliot tried to strike to stun and ended up just dazing L'Ombre; then dragging him back into the Jardin and putting one of the bags over his head

## Hints & possible hooks

### Hugues “L’Ombre” Lavallée & Les Ombres de la Rose (The Shadows of the Rose)

- The shadows are clearly not as powerful as they think they are (compared to our adventurers)
- L'Ombre is surprisingly knowledgable about the world ("Fairy dust - ha! I *know* that magic comes from warp dust, loved by Skaven and sorcerers, and the from winds from the Portals to the north")
- L'Ombre is a leader in the Shadows
- The Shadows are not actually powerful enough to successfully investigate Baron de Turenne

### Marcel

- Seemed quite knowledgable about what happened
- Maybe saw more than he let on
- Was decorating a shoe with a rose for the daughter of Baronesse de Beauchamp (in Session 1)
- Enjoyed seeing Duval get dismissed arrogantly by Turenne

## Ideas for this session

- It looks like the player's don't want to engage in the Shadow's dealings.
- Ellis (and obviously Karga) are unlikely to be co-operative.
- I guess Ellis will start by ensnaring L'Ombre
- He will most likely try to avoid getting hurt further but also needs to save face - his head is bleeding and bruised but so far no one, except Madame Rose, has seen him be overpowered
- Karge could threaten him: "It looks to me like you have two options: one, and this is the one that "Fluffy" likes - I remove that head of yours and then the bump won't matter any more; two - you leave us in peace, help us if we maybe need it in the future and I can arrange for our friend to maybe heal you so you don't need to lose face ... or any other body parts"

### Madame Rose

#### Motivation

##### Short Term: Time for mid-afternoon snack

##### Maintain Business Stability

- Her flower shop is likely a legitimate front for the Shadows
- She needs to keep appearances normal for regular customers
- Violence or obvious criminal activity would damage her reputation

##### Balance of Power

- She appears to be a more senior figure than L'Ombre
- Would want to maintain the Shadows' influence without drawing unwanted attention
- Needs to prevent escalation that could attract guards or nobles' interest

##### Information Gathering

- The conversation about Fae caught her attention (she let Eliot overhear it)
- May be genuinely interested in supernatural/magical knowledge
- Could see the party as potential future sources of valuable information

#### Potential dialogue hooks

- "My dears, perhaps we can find a more... civilized resolution? L'Ombre's enthusiasm sometimes exceeds his judgment, but we need not let this unpleasantness spoil future possibilities."
- "The gardens need tending, and I'm sure our guests have their own affairs to attend to. L'Ombre, I believe you've learned what you needed about our visitors' capabilities?"
- **"Should you return to our little town (or any of the others where we are represented), you'll find the Rose's thorns can be quite useful when properly aligned with mutual interests."**

### Knights on bridge - just after crossing into Robert's home region

- party is almost across a narrow bridge with Eliot in the lead
- a knight rides up with two more behind him and starts crossing
  - when you don't stop and retreat he begins to shout at you in Bretonnian
    - first reaction to agression from Eliot: "you clearly do not know our ways - so I will let this challenge to my honour pass but you *will* move out of the way and allow me to pass"
  - Ellis doesn't like water

### After passing the bridge you notice

- new colours on knights
- roads still well maintained but the farmhouses and buildings in the villages seem less well cared for
- people shopping in markets seem to hang their heads more they appear thinner and less energetic

### tax collectors

- you see knights with a fat man in a beautifully embroidered tunic riding into the fields

### Arrival at "Seeds of rebellion"

- **rising sun behind a metal chain**
  - graffiti?
  - paper note in street?
  - scratched into door / market stall
- also notice rose petal symbol in places

### Places

- Chênemorte ("Dead Oak") - reflecting both oppression and resilience
- Soufflecœur ("Heart's Sigh") - suggesting both weariness and hope
- Chaînefleur ("Chain Flower") - subtly referencing the rebellion symbol
- Griseforge ("Grey Forge") - hinting at industrial exploitation

### Sights

- A massive, gnarled oak tree in the town square - branches reaching like grasping hands
- Faded murals of Shallyan healing scenes, some partially covered by newer tax notices
- Empty market stalls with "SEIZED" notices nailed to them
- Shadowy alleyways where people quickly disappear when knights pass

### Sounds

- The constant rhythmic pounding from overtaxed forges
- Hushed conversations that stop when strangers approach
- A lone flute playing melancholy Bretonnian folk tunes at dusk
- The heavy tread of armored tax collectors' horses

### Smells

- Smoke from overworked forges mixing with morning mist
- Stale bread from the bakery (using lower quality flour after taxation)
- The sweet scent of wildflowers growing through cracks in the cobblestones
- The musty smell of damp thatch from poorly maintained roofs

### Key Locations

- The Dead Oak Inn (obvious meeting spot for dissidents)
- A dilapidated Shallyan shrine that doubles as a secret message drop
- The tax collector's office - a renovated noble house that stands out against the worn buildings
- A hidden cellar beneath the blacksmith's forge where rebels gather
