## Notes to self for the future

**The Metal Box:** The party found a magically warded metal box in Gérard’s house, containing two seals (one resembling "H.N." and one matching Baron Étienne’s symbol), a quill, and magic ink. This could be important for future plot points.
**The upcoming tournament** (in 2 + D4 days) is a significant event, culminating in Guy taking formal control of Caucy.
**Baron Étienne’s Role:** The party is planning to hand Gérard over to Baron Étienne de Montreuil, whose symbol matches one of the seals in the metal box. This connection could be highlighted.
**Guy’s Plan:** Guy de Caucy plans to replace Baron Étienne with Gérard, which is a critical subplot.
**Ellis’s Fey Nature:** While not directly relevant to Episodes 1 & 2, Ellis’s Fey background and her fear of fire, water, and wind might be worth noting for continuity
