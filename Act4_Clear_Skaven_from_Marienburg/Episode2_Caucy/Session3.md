## Baron Étienne de Montreuil

### Symbol: A golden stag leaping over a blue river, set against a white field

The stag represents nobility and vigilance, while the river symbolizes the lifeblood of the region’s trade and agriculture.
The white field reflects purity and honor, though it contrasts with the reality of his detachment from the struggles of his people.

### Personality and Role

Baron Étienne is a **well-meaning but aloof** noble who **genuinely believes** he is **doing his best for his people**. However, his **understanding** of their suffering is **filtered** through **layers of bureaucracy** and **sycophantic advisors**. He **sees himself** as a **benevolent ruler** but is **blind** to the **systemic issues** caused by his **policies** and the **corruption** of those under him.

**Constant fidgeting with a Signet Ring**: (Notice the **symbol matches** the one in the metal box)
Baron Étienne has a habit of **nervously twisting his golden signet ring** whenever he feels **uncertain** or **pressured**.
This small gesture betrays his lack of confidence in his own decisions.

**Overly Formal Speech**: He speaks in long, flowery sentences, often quoting outdated chivalric ideals, which can make him seem out of touch with the practical needs of his people. For example:

- **On his leadership philosophy**
  > "A ruler’s duty is to shine as a beacon of virtue, guiding his people as the stag leads its herd through the forest of life."

- **On the state of his domain:**
  > "The prosperity of my domain flows as freely as the river upon which our noble stag leaps, unburdened by the weight of despair."
  > "Surely, the bountiful harvests and the laughter of children in the fields are proof of our shared prosperity."

- **On his perception of Gérard:**
  > "Gérard has always struck me as a man of diligence and integrity, a true servant of the realm. I cannot fathom these accusations."

- **On the party’s evidence of corruption:**
  > "These documents... they cast a shadow upon the honor of my court. Yet, I must tread carefully, for justice must not be rushed like a river in flood."

- **On his vision for the future:**
  > "With the tournament approaching, I am confident that the spirit of chivalry will inspire unity and strength among my people."

### Relationship to Guy and Gérard

- **Guy’s Plan**: Guy de Caucy sees Baron Étienne as *weak and ineffective*, making him an easy target for replacement. Gérard, with his cunning and willingness to exploit others, is Guy’s intended replacement. Gérard’s ability to manipulate finances and enforce harsh measures aligns with Guy’s vision for tighter control over the region.
- **Étienne’s Blind Spot**: Baron Étienne is unaware of Gérard’s true nature and might even see him as a competent administrator, further highlighting his detachment from reality.

### How the Party Might Perceive Him

**Initially**, Baron Étienne may come across as **kind and honorable**, but his inability to grasp the depth of his people’s suffering could frustrate the party.

If the party presents evidence of Gérard’s corruption, Étienne might **struggle** to reconcile this with **his perception of Gérard**, leading to a moment of self-doubt and potential growth—or further denial.

## Montreuil-sur-Rivière

A picturesque town nestled along the banks of a wide, slow-moving river.

- The town is known for
  - cobblestone streets
  - charming timber-framed houses
  - grand stone bridge that connects the **two halves** of the settlement
- At its heart stands the **Baron’s manor**, a modest yet elegant structure surrounded by well-tended gardens.
- The town thrives on **trade and agriculture**, with bustling markets and riverboats constantly coming and going.

The Baron’s influence is evident everywhere, from the pristine streets to the carefully maintained public spaces. His efforts to uphold the ideals of chivalry and prosperity are clear, but so too is his detachment from the struggles of his people. The town feels like a reflection of Étienne himself—noble in intent, beautiful in appearance, but blind to the quiet hardships that ripple beneath the surface.

### Narrative Description

> Montreuil-sur-Rivière is a charming town that seems to embody the ideals of Bretonnian beauty and order—at least at first glance. Nestled along the banks of a wide, slow-moving river, the town is a picture of pastoral tranquility. Cobblestone streets wind gracefully between timber-framed houses painted in soft, cheerful hues, and flower boxes overflow with vibrant blooms, adding splashes of color to every corner.
>
> At the heart of the town stands the Baron’s manor, a modest yet elegant structure surrounded by meticulously tended gardens. The manor’s white walls gleam in the sunlight, and its golden stag emblem proudly adorns the gates, a symbol of nobility and vigilance. The river itself flows serenely beneath a grand stone bridge, its arches reflected in the water like a scene from a storybook.
>
>The markets are bustling but orderly, with vendors calling out their wares in melodic tones. Stalls display an abundance of fresh produce, fine textiles, and artisan goods, hinting at the region’s agricultural and trade prosperity. Children play along the riverbanks, their laughter mingling with the gentle hum of daily life.
>
>Yet, beneath this idyllic surface, subtle cracks begin to show. The townsfolk, while polite and welcoming, carry a quiet weariness in their eyes. Conversations often trail off into murmurs when knights or tax collectors pass by, their presence a reminder of the burdens imposed by the region’s governance. Notices of increased taxes are pinned discreetly to market boards, and a few empty stalls hint at merchants who could no longer afford their place.
