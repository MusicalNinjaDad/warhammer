# Session 2

## Recap

Last sesion the players arrived in Chaînefleur.

- Shortly before getting to the village they saw Gérard du Pont collecting money from Jean-Paul Dubois.
  - He was accompanied by 3 knights - one of whom knocked JP to the floor and bruised his ribs while the others laughed
  - Raya approached to help and, reulctantly, Eliiot followed
  - Eliot slipped JP 2 Gold to pay the taxes
  - Raya healed him
  - He advised them to stay at the Old Oak Inn and said he would try to repay them this evening
- In parallel they briefly met Sir Laurent
- At the Inn:
  - Eliot rolled 00 (best, double roll) for a perception check and:
    - Saw Gérard in the corner sorting money into two pouches
    - Read the notes over his shoulder and realised he was embezzeling taxes
  - Ellis stole 20 Silver from Gérards personal purse
  - Elliot noticed JP going to a back room and found a gathering of locals, lead by JP
  - Ellis was well received when she announced she had stolen back from him and then returned the coins to the villagers
  - Elliot made a successful Ld roll and the meeting listened to him

## Stealing back from the corrupt Tax-Collector

- The party will now:
  - Sneak into Gérard's home and steal back the money
  - Return the undeclared taxes which Gérard embezzeled to the villagers
  - Take Gérard to the next town, where they will hand him over to the local Nobel
  - They *may* also choose to burn down his house ... some are in favour, others against this.
- They can find his home by either:
  - following him from the inn
  - using Raya's location spell
  - ...?
- He will be alone at home and reasonably easy to overpower
- The home will be guarded one or more of the 3 knights (either on arrival or when leaving)

### Tax Collector - Gérard du Pont

- **Appearance**: Fat, sweating constantly, wears overly ornate clothing with gaudy gold trim
- **Short-term motivation**: Collect maximum taxes possible to impress Baron Guy de Caucy before the tournament
- **Background**: Former merchant who lost everything gambling, took this position to rebuild wealth through "creative accounting"
- **Quirk**: Constantly dabs at his forehead with a silk handkerchief while talking, switches between fawning to superiors and cruel to peasants

#### Exterior

- Freshly whitewashed walls (trying to hide cheaper stone construction)
- Small decorative turret (more for show than function)
- Iron-bound oak front door with oversized brass knocker
- Small stable for 2 horses
- Walled garden with imported ornamental plants
