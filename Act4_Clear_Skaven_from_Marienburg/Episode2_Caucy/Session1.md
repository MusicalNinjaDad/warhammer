# Session 1

## Recap

Last session, the players successfully resolved the situation with the shadows of the rose and entered Caucy:

- "Ombré" turned out to be a bit of a coward and accepted the offer to be healed by Raya at the Tavern where they were staying - in order to save face
- Madame Rose helped take the heat out of the interaction - seeing that Elliot was looking for a peacful conclusion with benefits for the party while Ellis and Karga were more inclined to take revenge for their imprisonment
- Ellis now has a golden token for Les Ombres de la Rose (The Shadows of the Rose) based on her skills as a pickpocket, the rest of the party have received wooden tokens
- Mme Rose will try to gather information about where dragons can be found and will ensure that the info gets to the players
- Ellis has told the rest of the party about her background and name
- The met the Knights on the Bridge, Elliot's new shining shield, boots etc. and understanding of emperial ettiquette was enough avoid vioence - the knight backed away but not without plenty of insults and leaving a suitable feeling about the difference in Caucy from the previous region

## Episode 2 - Ideas

- Tax collectors: See tax collector & knights in field hitting a farm worker & laughing
- Seeds of Rebellion
- Touring troupe of actors ("the petals"): on their way to the tournament. One night only - a special show (making fun of our party) a group of dragon hunters (gives the party the info about dragons)
- The tournament: Guy de Caucy has received a letter from his brother, who has recovered slightly from his illness and abdicated to him; he is throwing a tournament in his honour

## Tax collectors

- Party sees a fat, well dressed man in the field shouting at one of the farmers
- an accompanying knight gets off his horse an knocks the peasant to the ground and kicks him
- the other onlooking knights laugh and jeer
- if required will be approached by a wandering knight (metarole: guide), who has lost faith in the way virtual and honour are lived in Caucy. "Seems the weight of these taxes crushes more than just coin purses. Tell me, how long must your people suffer under this yoke?"

### Tax Collector - Gérard du Pont

- **Appearance**: Fat, sweating constantly, wears overly ornate clothing with gaudy gold trim
- **Short-term motivation**: Collect maximum taxes possible to impress Baron Guy de Caucy before the tournament
- **Background**: Former merchant who lost everything gambling, took this position to rebuild wealth through "creative accounting"
- **Quirk**: Constantly dabs at his forehead with a silk handkerchief while talking, switches between fawning to superiors and cruel to peasants

### Brutal Knight - Sir Michel "The Hammer" Fontaine

- **Appearance**: Muscular but going to seed, poorly maintained armor with rust spots
- **Short-term motivation**: Enjoys bullying peasants to feel powerful, wants to impress tax collector for extra coins
- **Background**: Third son of minor noble, couldn't inherit land so became a brutal enforcer
- **Quirk**: Laughs wheezily after every sentence, even when nothing is funny

### Peasant Farmer - Jean-Paul Dubois

- **Appearance**: Weather-beaten face, surprisingly dignified despite worn clothes
- **Short-term motivation**: Trying to save enough of his crop to feed his family through winter
- **Background**: Once owned his own land but lost it through previous excessive taxation
- **Quirk**: Even when beaten, maintains eye contact and refuses to bow his head

### Wandering Knight - Sir Laurent de la Verdière

- **Appearance**: Well-maintained but plain armor. Black shield.
- **Short-term motivation**: Looking for allies to help reform Caucy's corrupt system
- **Background**: Former court knight who left after witnessing too much corruption and cruelty
- **Quirk**: Habitually touches the Shallyan symbol on his shield when troubled or thinking deeply

## Seeds of Rebellion

### Chaînefleur ("Chain Flower") village

- Takes place in Chaînefleur ("Chain Flower") village, home of Jean-Paul Dubois
- The village symbol (rising sun behind a metal chain) appears as graffiti around town, echoing the resistance symbols the party saw when first entering Caucy
- Some wooden rose petals (like the party's tokens) can be spotted discretely placed near these symbols

### Connections to Episode 1

- The **Shadows of the Rose** have informants here watching the tax collectors
- **Marcel the shoemaker** has **family in this village**
- News of Elliot's diplomatic handling of the bridge encounter has reached here, giving hope that not all nobles/knights are corrupt

### Current Situation

- The **tax collectors** make an **example of Jean-Paul Dubois**, one of the **last independent farmers**
- Sir Laurent observes from afar, gauging the party's reaction
- Villagers **whisper about** the **upcoming tournament**, seeing it as both a **burden** (extra taxes) and **opportunity** (nobles will be distracted)
- The **Dead Oak Inn** serves as a discrete meeting place for those who oppose the current regime

This ties into the tournament plot as the peasants **hope to use the distraction of the celebrations to organize some form of resistance**
