## PCs

### Raya

Young, female human, Shallyan cleric, level 3. Played by B (aged 12.75).

#### History

- Originally from Marienburg
- Was an entertainer / knife-thrower before becoming an initiate
- Chose to devote herself to Shallya after feeling so bad about cutting a gangster's throat to get accepted by a rival (Marienburg) gang at the end of [[Oldenhaller Contract]], which we used as an intro to the game and springboard for the rest of our epic.

#### Motivations & Interests

- Passion for healing
  - always visits local Shalyan temple to help with healing the sick
  - learnt herb-lore and healing very early
  - now specilising in magical healing (incl poisons)
- Doesn't want to cause harm:
  - Uses the spell "Sleep" in battle to drop opponents (who then tend to get splatted by the rest of the party)
  - Will not use any sharp weapons
  - Skilled with bolas and throwing wooden balls but no longer uses them because of feear of doing too much damage
  - Carries a quarter-staff but has not trained with it because of fear of doing too much damage
- Has plenty of magic points
- Tries to understanding the background to adversaries (what drive them to act evily)
  - e.g. a necromancer who was raising dead in return for a choas god keeping his son alive: she healed the son after the party had subdued the necromancer
- Blessed by Verena to understand Brettonian
- Working out the [[real teachings of Shallya]]
  - Has found part of what seem to be Shallya's original writings. The messages within are considered blasphemous by the well-established, powerful church.
  - Misunderstanding about what "mercy" and "healing mean"
  - Willingness to show mercy to followers too (commonly believed that someone who had ever taken a life would never be accepted by Shallya)
  - Who it applies to: common approach is "humans", but what about other intelligent creatures? what about a creatures natural range of alignments? ...
- Cannot read / write

#### Favourite adventure so far

A group of orphans were missing; the party found them locked up by a necromancer who was killing them to raise again; necromancer fled when overpowered by the group; she found the magic ring which unlocked the door to their cell

### Eliot

Young, male, Verenan Templar. Played by L (aged 14)

#### History

- Originally from Middenheim
- Career: Squire - Freelance - Templar

#### Motivations & Interests

- Able to read & write (rare ability in the Old World & player is dyslexic)
  - Thirst for knowledge lead to interest in Verena
  - visits libraries at Verenan temples whenever available
  - keeping a journal of the adventures and leaving copies in verenan temples along the way
- Great with and loves animals
  - Trained his current warhorse "Storm" (Tilian, faster and more nimble than traditional northern warhorses)
  - Trained and travels with a young pigmy giant own "squeek" (also roleplays squeek during combat)
- Now wields "Truthseeker"
  - a bastard-flail blessed by Verena and hidden for centuries until a worthy follower would find it (Eliot)
  - very little lore known about Truthseeker & no special powers yet identified
  - prefers to wield two-handed for additional damage
- Skilled fighter
  - Can wield two-handed weapons or dual-wield one-handed weapons
  - Skilled at parrying and has a specilist forked dagger (rarely used)
  - Also has a custom-made short-sword with an owl-pommel (rarely used at the moment)
  - Wears chain mail for manouverability, would like to find magical platemail (but is not aware of the movement restrictions this would cause)
  - Has 3 attacks and a high WS and very high S, T, W
- Tends to be impulsive and run straight into action
  - Currently wearing an old, borrowed show as he lost his in the last fight when he ran staright into a bog at night and sank up to his knees trying to run at a group of goblins
- Wants to become famous for his deeds and recognised when he goes places.

#### Favourite bits of the game

- Simple combat without too much environmental concern / complication - although this is boring for the others. Likes to see just how hard he can hit.
- Really enjoyed roleplaying squeek on the two occaisions we have done it in the past

## Accompanying NPCs

As there are only 2 players, I play a few NPCs to help balance the party and add some extra fun. The players have a lot of fun with them and they are not just "meat shields".

### Karga

- Female dwarf from Altdorf
- Has been with the party from the start (directly after [[Oldenhaller Contract]])
- Wields two axes "Fluffy" and "Earthshaker" named after her boyfriends (one with hardly any beard, the other who snored terribly)
- Was a City Watchman, then helped as a guard on river transports, which is how she met the party
- Stereotypical caustic dwarf who has a bit of a thing about anything that a "not-dwarf":
  - "You folks are pretty good not-dwarfs"
  - "You wouldn't see me trusting and riding any not-dwarf; and no self respecting dwarf would allow themselves to be ridden" - so her uncle made her a set of sprung leg-extensions and she can keep up with the mounted players on foot.
  - "Where's my book of grudges...? That one is getting a WHOLE PAGE!"
- Lowest I of the group with decent WS, S, T, W, A=2 (so can balance combat well)

### Robert de-Caucy

- Human Bretonnian noble
- Saved by the party when the stopped at a mid-river island asylum / fortress where he had been sent by his brother who wanted him out of the way
- [[Raya]] cured him of the mental illnesses which he had developed at the asylum

### Ellis

- New character, not yet properly introduced to the group
- The creation of B (who plays Raya) and will likely become a second PC for her to play
- Is a Fey (a fully made up creature) pretending to be human with illusion powers and elemental powers (earth) but a fear of the other elements (fire, water, wind)
